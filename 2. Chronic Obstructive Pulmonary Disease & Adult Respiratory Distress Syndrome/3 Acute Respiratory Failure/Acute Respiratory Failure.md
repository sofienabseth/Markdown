# Respiratory failure 

Gas exchange is so severely impaired that arterial hypercapnea or hypoxemia occurs
* Hypoxemia - PaO2 <80
* Hypercapnea - PaCO2>50. Directly linked to inadequate gas exchange

### PaCO2 > 50
* Acute. PaCO2 rises rapidly, producing an abnormal pH and an immediate threat to life 
* Chronic. Arterial pH is close to normal regardless of PaCO2

### Alveolar Hypoventilation
* Unable to remove all the CO2 produced by cellular metabolism, unable to load sufficient O2
* CO2 accumulates in the blood
* PaCO2 rises and PaO2 falls

# Question 1
What indicates arterial hypercapnea and hypoxemia?

[RIGHT] PaO2 < 80 indicates Hypoxemia, PaCO2 > 50 indicates Hypercapnea
[WRONG] PaCO2 < 50 indicates Hypercapnea, PaO2 > 80 indicates Hypoxemia

# Question 2
Which laboratory result indicates chronic ventilatory failure?

[RIGHT] Arterial pH is close to normal regardless of PaCO2
[WRONG] PaCO2 rises rapidly, producing an abnormal pH threat
[WRONG] Arterial pH is abnormal as a result of high PaCO2

# Question 3
What is the result of alevolar hypoventilation? 

[RIGHT] CO2 accumulates in the blood, PaCO2 rises and PaO2 falls
[WRONG] O2 accumulates in the blood, PaCO2 falls and PaO2 rises

# Clinical categories and determinants of Acute Respiratory Failure

### Clinical Category 
Failure of alveolar ventilation

### Clinical Determinants
*  Increased PaCO2
*  Decreased pH
*  Decreased PaO2

### Clinical Category 
Failure of arterial blood oxygenation
* Hypoxemia
* Inadequate inspired oxygen

### Clinical Determinants
* Decreased PaO2
* Decreased SaO2

### Clinical Category
* Failure of tissue oxygenation
* Inadequate systemic O2 delivery
* Inadequate tissue O2 extraction

### Clinical Determinants
* Decreased CaO2
* Decreased VO2

# Question 4
What are the clinical determinants of failure of alveolar ventilation?

[RIGHT] Increased PaCO2 , decreased pH, decreased PaO2
[WRONG] Decreased PaCO2 , increased pH, increased PaO2
[WRONG] Increased PaCO2 , increased pH, decreased PaO2

# Question 5
What are the clinical determinants of failure of arterial blood oxygenation?

[RIGHT]  Decreased PaO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Decreased PaCO2 , increased SaO2
[WRONG]  Increased PaCO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Increased PaO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Decreased PaO2 , increased SaO2

# Clinical Presentation

### Hypoxemia
Symptoms: Restlessness, agitation, disorientation, confusion, delirium, dyspnea
Physical Findings: Cardiac dysrhythmias, tachycardia, cyanosis, labored breathing, tachypnea

### Hypercapnia
Symptoms: Headache, somnolence, dizziness, coma, confusion
Physical Findings: Hypertension, tachycardia, muscle twitching, diaphoresis

### Acidosis
Symptoms: Coma
Physical Findings: Cardiac dysrhythmias

# Diagnostics
* ABG. PaO2 < 80 mmHg, PaCO2 >50mmHg
* CXR

# Management 
* Improve oxygenation and ventilation
* Maintain optimal cardiac output: Fluid or inotropic support or vasoactive support
* Normalize Hgb
* Treat underlying conditions
* Sedation/paralysis/pain management
* Nutritional support
* Positioning
