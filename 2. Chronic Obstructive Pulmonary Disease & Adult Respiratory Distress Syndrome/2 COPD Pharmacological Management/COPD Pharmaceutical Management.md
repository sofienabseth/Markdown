# Management

### Goals to achieve include:
* Improvement in gas exchange
* Achievement of airway clearance
* Improvement in breathing pattern
* Independence in self-care activities
* Improvement in activity intolerance
* Ventilation/oxygenation adequate to meet self-care needs
* Nutritional intake meeting caloric needs
* Infection treated/prevented
* Disease process/prognosis and therapeutic regimen understood
* Plan in place to meet needs after discharge

# Question 6
Goals to achieve in management of patients with COPD include all of the following, EXCEPT:

[WRONG] Achievement of airway clearance
[WRONG] Improvement in breathing pattern
[WRONG] Independence in self-care activities
[RIGHT] Continuation of existing lifestyle

* The patient should be made aware of existing habits which are causing COPD (e.g. smoking, exposure to chemicals) and encouraged to make changes.

### Nursing priorities
* Maintain airway patency
* Assist with measures to facilitate gas exchange
* Enhance nutritional intake
* Prevent complications, slow progression of condition
* Provide information about disease process/prognosis and treatment regimen

# Nursing Care Plan interventions
* Patient and family teaching is an important nursing intervention to enhance self-management in patients with any chronic pulmonary disorder

To achieve airway clearance:
* The nurse must appropriately administer bronchodilators and corticosteroids and become alert for potential side effects.
Direct or controlled coughing
* The nurse instructs the patient in direct or controlled coughing, which produces a more effective cough effort and reduces fatigue

To improve breathing pattern:
* Inspiratory muscle training: This may help improve the breathing pattern
* Diaphragmatic breathing: Diaphragmatic breathing reduces respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and sometimes helps expel as much air as possible during expiration
* Pursed lip breathing: Pursed lip breathing helps slow expiration, prevents collapse of small airways, and controls the rate and depth of respiration

To improve activity intolerance:
* Manage daily activities: Daily activities must be paced throughout the day and support devices can be also used to decrease energy expenditure
* Exercise training: Exercise training can help strengthen muscles of the upper and lower extremities and improve exercise tolerance and endurance
* Walking aids: Use of walking aids may be recommended to improve activity levels and safety with ambulation

To monitor and manage potential complications:
* Monitor cognitive changes: The nurse should monitor for cognitive changes such as personality and behavior changes and memory impairment
* Monitor pulse oximetry values: Pulse oximetry values are used to assess the patient’s need for oxygen and administer supplemental oxygen as prescribed
* Prevent infection: The nurse should encourage the patient to be immunized against influenza and S. pneumonia because the patient is prone to respiratory infection

Evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions outlined in the plan of care can be achieved by verifying that the patient:
* Identifies hazards of cigarette smoking
* Identifies resources for smoking cessation
* Enrolls in smoking cessation program
* Minimizes or eliminates exposures
* Verbalizes the need for adequate fluids
* Remains free of infection
* Practices breathing techniques
* Performs activities with less shortness of breath

# Guidelines 

### Discharge and Home Care Guidelines

It is important for the nurse to assess the knowledge of patient and family members about self-care and the therapeutic regimen.

* Setting goals: If the COPD is mild, the objectives of the treatment are to increase exercise tolerance and prevent further loss of pulmonary function. If the COPD is severe, the objectives are to preserve current pulmonary function and relieve symptoms as much as possible.

* Temperature control: The nurse should instruct the patient to avoid extremes of heat, cold, and altitude. Heat and cold increase the oxygen requirements and high altitudes increase hypoxemia.

* Activity moderation: The patient should adapt a lifestyle of moderate activity and avoid emotional disturbances or stressful situations that might trigger a coughing episode.

* Breathing retraining: The nurse must provide the education and breathing retraining necessary to optimize the patient’s functional status

### Documentation Guidelines

Documentation is an essential part of the patient’s chart to reflect the plans, interventions and medications, and the patient's responses to the treatment.

* Document assessment findings including level of alertness, respiratory rate, character of breath sounds; frequency, amount and appearance of secretions, and laboratory findings 
* Document conditions that interfere with oxygen supply
* Document plan of care and specific interventions
* Document liters of supplemental oxygen
* Document client’s responses to treatment, teaching, and actions performed
* Document teaching plan
* Document modifications to plan of care
* Document attainment or progress towards goals


# Treatment

The following are treatments to manage COPD:
* Smoking cessation 
* Reducing exposure to airway irritants
* Supplementing oxygen
* Preventing infection
* Treating infection/purulent sputum with antimicrobials
* Administering medications similar to those used for asthma


# Anticholinergic agents
* Decrease airway secretions and smooth muscle tone
* Tipratropium bromide (Atrovent) and tiotropium bromide (Spiriva)
* Side effects – dry mouth and hacking cough


# Bronchodilators

### Short acting inhaled agents - 2 puffs QID and PRN
* Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin)
* Metaproterenol (Alupent)
* Pirbuterol (Maxir)
* Terbutaline (Brethine) 2 puffs TID

### Short acting ORAL agents. 
* Albuterol (Volmax) – 2 – 4 mg TID
* Albuterol extended release (Repetab) 4 mg q 12h

### Long acting inhaled agents 
* Salmeterol (Serevent). Prolonged receptor-binding, requires patient education to avoid cardiac arrhythmias
